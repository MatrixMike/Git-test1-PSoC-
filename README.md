# Git-test1-PSoC-
This repo documents the stages in creating a Project and it's Workpace in PSoC. I have several projects on 
a Windows laptop that need to be saved to github - so this is a small step in the journey of saving my work
prior to reformatting some donated laptops that have been used to create projects.
